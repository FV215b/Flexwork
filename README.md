### Flexwork ###

Flexwork = Flexible Framework

##Overview##

Flexible is a flexible RESTful backend framework which provides simple backend solution for app developers.
We run a server which receives HTTP request, handles database query and sends HTTP response back to the client.
Developers define the query fields they need and make request as they want.

##Explanation##

We divides our code into two directories, backend/ and frontend/. The backend/ has all the codes and files for Flexwork. The frontend/ has a demo app runs on Flexwork to show how Flexwork works and what does it provides.
