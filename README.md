### Flexwork ###

Flexwork = Flexible Framework

Flexible is a flexible RESTful backend framework which provides simple backend solution for app developers.
We run a server which receives HTTP request, handles database query and sends HTTP response back to the client.
Developers define the query fields they need and make request as they want.
